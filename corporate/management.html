<!-- Product -->
    <h3 class= "corporate-subtitle">Product</h3>
	<p class= "corporate-bodytext" style="white-space: pre-line;"> Rolecall is a creative hub built for the next generation of theatre makers in the Netherlands. Whether you're an actor, director, or writer, this is your stage to grow, connect, and be seen.

	  	  <!-- Problem -->
    <h3 class= "corporate-subtitle">Problem</h3>
	  
	<h4 class= "corporate-detailtext" style="white-space: pre-line;"> Difficult to find auditions in one place </h4>
	<p class= "corporate-bodytext" style="white-space: pre-line;"> Aspiring actors often struggle to find auditions, especially without an agent or agency. Most amateur actors have to rely on paid websites like Backstage to find roles, and even then, they may not be qualified, in the area, or it may not be a role that fits them.  </p>

	<h4 class= "corporate-detailtext" style="white-space: pre-line;">Lack of personalized filters </h4>
	<p class= "corporate-bodytext" style="white-space: pre-line;"> One of the biggest issues that actors face is finding auditions, let alone booking the role. Pre-existing casting websites may only go as far as to specify your age and gender, barely focusing on the true needs and desires of those on the prowl for a job. </p>
		
	<h4 class= "corporate-detailtext" style="white-space: pre-line;">No effective platform for showing actor portfolio</h4>
	<p class= "corporate-bodytext" style="white-space: pre-line;"> Casting platforms are only made for the actor searching for a role, yet there is no outlet for those searching for actors. It is unheard of to post a portfolio online, showcasing previous projects and talents that can be brought to the table.</p>

	<h4 class= "corporate-detailtext" style="white-space: pre-line;">Lack of industry connections </h4>
	<p class= "corporate-bodytext" style="white-space: pre-line;"> Similar to the film and TV industry, connections is everything. It is all about who you know. Without an agent, it is virtually impossible to find anything if one has no connections. Platforms have no outlet to connect with other actors and casting directors, there is no medium to bridge the gap between these faults. 
		
    </p>
	  
	  	  <!-- Solution -->
    <h3 class= "corporate-subtitle">Solution</h3>
	  
	<h4 class= "corporate-detailtext" style="white-space: pre-line;">Online platform for networking and finding autitions </h4>
	<p class= "corporate-bodytext" style="white-space: pre-line;"> Role Call is a website designed for the theater lovers who want to connect, inspire, and perform. With this medium, it will be easier than ever to reach the audiences not only in the theater, but in the networking world. Actors will be able to directly message and comunicate with companies and casting directors, and the latter will be able to directly view actors' portfolios' and assess immediately. </p>

	<h4 class= "corporate-detailtext" style="white-space: pre-line;">Using AI to make each profile user-specific </h4>
	<p class= "corporate-bodytext" style="white-space: pre-line;"> With the advancements in AI, each user will see content and job opportunities catered to them and their innterests, boosting engagement and likelihood of returning and coninutation of the use of the website. </p>
		
	<h4 class= "corporate-detailtext" style="white-space: pre-line;">Ability to share resume pubicly with added pictures and videos</h4>
	<p class= "corporate-bodytext" style="white-space: pre-line;"> With the addidtion of adding photos and videos to a resume, for a casting director an actor will not only look good on paper, but the proof will be only a click away on the user's profile. Adding photos and videos from specific performances, similar to an athlete's highlight reel, will prove their talent and have a higher likelihood of building a network and furthering their resume with Role Call.
