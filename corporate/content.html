	<p class= "corporate-bodytext" style="white-space: pre-line;"> In a world where aspiring actors feel like their dreams are out of reach, we believe that talent should never go unnoticed. Our mission is to create a space where every passionate actor can get a chance to do what they love the most-bringing stories to life.

    <strong>Logo:</strong> In the logo we decided to display a megaphone for two reasons. One of them would be the way this object is linked to the theater industry, since it is used by directors to communicate with actors during rehearsals. This makes our logo recognisable for our target group and gives a first impression of who this brand is directed to. The second reason would be the link to our brand name “Role Call” as this makes the meaning of it stronger and understandable. It can be seen as a call for people in the theater industry which match with our brand value “opportunity for all”. We chose a simplistic design so it can be easy to recreate and to avoid it being perceived as overwhelming.

    <strong>Fonts:</strong> For the font we decided to use “Be Vietnam Pro” as we wanted to make it bold, clear and easy to read.

    <strong>Style guide (logo usage, color schemes, typography, and design layouts):</strong> The logo of our brand will be very present on our website and will be the first thing potential customers will see when visiting. This will make our brand recognisable by it and form a clear brand identity.

    Regarding our color scheme we opt for darker red tones as this represents passion and love — two feelings that represent our target group — as well as feelings of energy, action, power and confidence. It is also great for highlighting as it is a color that grabs attention. On the other hand, we have some black on the homepage to create more drama and a more formal feeling. In contrast with the strong character of red, we decided to add some cream tones to make our brand feel more gentle and approachable.

    The layout of the website was chosen in a more intuitive way. We wanted to make the website look clear and structured. Since there are many elements to our brand it is important to have everything organized and in places that make sense. We aimed to create an easy-to-use website that everyone understands. This matches with our brand value visibility and access. The typography was chosen to make everything readable and visually appealing.

    <strong>The Limelight:</strong> In the world of performance, being “in the limelight” means being center stage, seen and celebrated. It’s where actors shine. Through this project, we aim to put aspiring creatives into that spotlight — helping them showcase their talent, connect with the right people, and take their place in the theatre world with confidence. This is why we use this name for the page where they can find roles.
