<!-- Product -->
    <h3 class= "corporate-subtitle">Product</h3>
	<p class= "corporate-bodytext" style="white-space: pre-line;"> Rolecall is a creative hub built for the next generation of theatre makers in the Netherlands. Whether you're an actor, director, or writer, this is your stage to grow, connect, and be seen.
    </p>
	<img src="../images/lean canvas.png" alt="lean canvas" class="img-fluid w-80 mb-3"/>
	  
	  	  <!-- Problem -->
    <h3 class= "corporate-subtitle">Problem</h3>
	  
	<h4 class= "corporate-detailtext" style="white-space: pre-line;"> Difficult to find auditions in one place </h4>
	<p class= "corporate-bodytext" style="white-space: pre-line;"> Aspiring actors often struggle to find auditions, especially without an agent or agency. Most amateur actors have to rely on paid websites like Backstage to find roles, and even then, they may not be qualified, in the area, or it may not be a role that fits them. This leads to hours of wasted time and missed opportunities. The current landscape is fragmented, with casting calls scattered across social media, forums, or hidden behind expensive paywalls. Role Call solves this by centralizing auditions in one platform, making it accessible and inclusive for all.  </p>

	<h4 class= "corporate-detailtext" style="white-space: pre-line;">Lack of personalized filters </h4>
	<p class= "corporate-bodytext" style="white-space: pre-line;"> One of the biggest issues that actors face is finding auditions, let alone booking the role. Pre-existing casting websites may only go as far as to specify your age and gender, barely focusing on the true needs and desires of those on the prowl for a job. Every actor is unique — from their niche (e.g., musical theater vs. experimental drama) to their skill set, schedule, and career goals. Current platforms overlook this individuality. Role Call uses AI to offer highly personalized recommendations, increasing the chances of finding the right roles faster. </p>
		
	<h4 class= "corporate-detailtext" style="white-space: pre-line;">No effective platform for showing actor portfolio</h4>
	<p class= "corporate-bodytext" style="white-space: pre-line;"> Casting platforms are only made for the actor searching for a role, yet there is no outlet for those searching for actors. It is unheard of to post a portfolio online, showcasing previous projects and talents that can be brought to the table. A resumé alone doesn't capture an actor’s presence, versatility, or emotional range. Videos, monologues, and headshots are vital but underutilized. Role Call allows users to build dynamic, media-rich portfolios that directors and companies can actively browse — reversing the search process and creating inbound opportunities.</p>

	<h4 class= "corporate-detailtext" style="white-space: pre-line;">Lack of industry connections </h4>
	<p class= "corporate-bodytext" style="white-space: pre-line;"> Similar to the film and TV industry, connections is everything. It is all about who you know. Without an agent, it is virtually impossible to find anything if one has no connections. Platforms have no outlet to connect with other actors and casting directors, there is no medium to bridge the gap between these faults. Most aspiring actors are excluded from industry networks, and existing platforms do little to create genuine connection. Role Call bridges this gap by offering features like direct messaging, industry matchmaking, and live audition networking events — helping actors build visibility and credibility from day one.

	  	  <!-- Solution -->
    <h3 class= "corporate-subtitle">Solution</h3>
	  
	<h4 class= "corporate-detailtext" style="white-space: pre-line;">Online platform for networking and finding autitions </h4>
	<p class= "corporate-bodytext" style="white-space: pre-line;"> Role Call is a website designed for the theater lovers who want to connect, inspire, and perform. With this medium, it will be easier than ever to reach the audiences not only in the theater, but in the networking world. Actors will be able to directly message and comunicate with companies and casting directors, and the latter will be able to directly view actors' portfolios' and assess immediately. Getting rid of the middlemen in the typical casting process simplifies the process for everyone.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

	<h4 class= "corporate-detailtext" style="white-space: pre-line;">Using AI to make each profile user-specific </h4>
	<p class= "corporate-bodytext" style="white-space: pre-line;"> With the advancements in AI, each user on Role Call will experience a uniquely tailored journey. The platform will learn from a user's activity, interests, past roles, skill sets, and engagement patterns to recommend auditions, networking opportunities, and content that are highly relevant to them. This goes far beyond simple filters like age or location — AI will analyze nuances in performance history, preferences, and even artistic goals to surface opportunities they’re more likely to succeed in and feel passionate about. This hyper-personalization dramatically boosts engagement, as users feel the platform understands their individual path. It also increases the likelihood of returning users, creating a feedback loop where the more they use Role Call, the smarter and more helpful it becomes. In an industry where most actors feel lost in the crowd, this AI-driven guidance acts like a digital agent — helping users feel seen, empowered, and equipped to grow.	&nbsp; </p>
		
	<h4 class= "corporate-detailtext" style="white-space: pre-line;">Ability to share resume pubicly with added pictures and videos</h4>
	<p class= "corporate-bodytext" style="white-space: pre-line;"> With the addidtion of adding photos and videos to a resume, for a casting director an actor will not only look good on paper, but the proof will be only a click away on the user's profile. Adding photos and videos from specific performances, similar to an athlete's highlight reel, will prove their talent and have a higher likelihood of building a network and furthering their resume with Role Call.

    <h3 class= "corporate-subtitle">Customer segments</h3>

	<p class= "corporate-bodytext" style="white-space: pre-line;"> • Drama students

		• Local theaters
		• amateur actors
		
		Role call is focused more on the amateur / start-up side of the theater industry, giving a boost to those who need it. When an actor is starting out, they may not know where to go or what to do.

Local theaters will be able to spread the word of their performances to a wider audience, attracting more people for auditions and creating a better show overall. </p>
	  
	<h4 class= "corporate-detailtext" style="white-space: pre-line;">Ideal customer</h4>
	  <p class= "corporate-undertext" style="white-space: pre-line;">'An aspiring actor or Drama student with strong interest in being a theatre actor/actress and building their resumé.'</p>
	  <p class= "corporate-bodytext" style="white-space: pre-line;"> The ideal customer for Role Call is an aspiring theater actor between the ages of 18 and 35 who is in the early stages of their career. They may have recently graduated from a performing arts program or are transitioning into theater from related fields such as dance or musical performance. This actor is highly motivated to grow their presence in the industry, regularly searches for auditions, and is eager to build a compelling portfolio. However, they often feel lost in traditional casting platforms, overwhelmed by irrelevant listings, and limited by static resumés that don’t fully showcase their talent. They typically don’t have an agent and are seeking direct access to casting opportunities. Tech-savvy and open to innovation, they value personalized tools that save time and help them stand out. Role Call offers exactly what they need: tailored audition recommendations powered by AI, a multimedia resumé builder to showcase their unique skills through photos and video clips, and a streamlined way to connect directly with theater companies and casting directors. For this customer, Role Call is more than a platform—it’s a launchpad for their acting career.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

	  	  <!-- Unfair advandages -->
    <h3 class= "corporate-subtitle">Unfair advandages</h3>
	  
	<h4 class= "corporate-detailtext" style="white-space: pre-line;">A networking website where opportunities are catered specifically to the user</h4>
	<p class= "corporate-bodytext" style="white-space: pre-line;"> Unfair advantage: Traditional casting platforms offer general listings. By leveraging AI to tailor opportunities based on a user’s skill set, interests, and experience, Role Call saves time and increases hit rates for auditions — something competitors likely don’t do as smartly or personally. 
	Why it’s hard to replicate: Requires strong data science, AI models, and personalized recommendation logic that most generic platforms won’t have the resources or data to implement. </p>
	  
	<h4 class= "corporate-detailtext" style="white-space: pre-line;">A direct line of access from actors to companies and theater groups </h4>
	<p class= "corporate-bodytext" style="white-space: pre-line;"> Unfair advantage: Bypasses middlemen like agents or casting directories. Direct access democratizes exposure and reduces gatekeeping — a unique draw for newer actors. 
		Why it’s hard to replicate: Establishing trusted, two-way industry connections (between aspiring actors and legit theater groups) takes time, reputation, and trust — a big barrier for new entrants.
