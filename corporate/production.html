  <section style= "background-color: #fff7ef;">
  <div class= "container py-4">
	  
    <h3 class= "corporate-subtitle">Tone of voice</h3>
	  <h4 class="corporate-undertext">Supportive, inspiring, &amp; creative</h4>
	<p class= "corporate-bodytext" style="white-space: pre-line;"> Since our platform is aimed at actors and creatives, the tone must reflect the emotions and aspirations of this audience. A supportive and motivating tone encourages users to feel confident sharing their work and reaching out for opportunities. It also aligns with the community-driven and collaborative spirit of theater.
	
		
	</p>
	  
	<h3 class= "corporate-subtitle">Product</h3>
	<p class= "corporate-bodytext" style="white-space: pre-line;"> Our product fills a gap in the Dutch theater scene, where many actors still rely on word-of-mouth or scattered platforms to find roles and connect. By offering a centralized, professional network, we create a space for actors to build visibility, discover projects, and grow artistically and professionally.
	
		
	</p>
	  
	<h3 class= "corporate-subtitle">Key elements</h3>
	<h4 class="corporate-undertext">Portfolio feature</h4>
	<p class= "corporate-bodytext" style="white-space: pre-line;"> Actors need a space to showcase headshots, past performances, and showreels. A portfolio feature helps them present their work professionally, increasing their chances of being discovered and cast.
	
	</p>
	  
	<h4 class="corporate-undertext">The Limelight feed</h4>
	<p class= "corporate-bodytext" style="white-space: pre-line;"> This feed functions like a curated social wall where actors can share updates, behind-the-scenes content, or industry news. It promotes community engagement and encourages visibility.
	
	</p>
	  
	<h4 class="corporate-undertext">Networking directory</h4>
	<p class= "corporate-bodytext" style="white-space: pre-line;"> A directory of users, including actors, directors, and theater groups, helps users connect meaningfully, find collaborators, or get advice—much like LinkedIn but focused on creative professions.
	
	</p>
	  
	<h4 class="corporate-undertext">Workshop &amp; Event listings</h4>
	<p class= "corporate-bodytext" style="white-space: pre-line;"> Professional development is crucial in the acting world. This feature helps users find opportunities to improve their skills and expand their network, adding value beyond just casting calls.
	
		
	</p>
	  
	<h3 class= "corporate-subtitle">Visual identity</h3>
	<h4 class="corporate-undertext">Deep Burgundy (#67171f)</h4>
	<p class= "corporate-bodytext" style="white-space: pre-line;"> This color evokes passion and elegance, often associated with theater curtains and drama, reinforcing the emotional depth of acting.
	
	</p>
	  
	<h4 class="corporate-undertext">Cream (#efdbbe)</h4>
	<p class= "corporate-bodytext" style="white-space: pre-line;"> Soft and warm, this tone balances the intensity of the burgundy and reflects approachability and creativity.
	
	</p>
	  
	<h4 class="corporate-undertext">Warm Sand (#f0e3d2)</h4>
	<p class= "corporate-bodytext" style="white-space: pre-line;"> A subtle neutral that enhances readability and maintains a grounded, professional feel without being too corporate.
	
	</p>
	  
	<h4 class="corporate-undertext">Logo</h4>
	<p class= "corporate-bodytext" style="white-space: pre-line;">The logo uses simple shapes and strong contrast to stand out, with a bold megaphone icon that clearly ties into the name “Role Call.” 
	It feels loud and direct—in a good way—symbolizing that this platform gives people a voice and a place to be seen. The brighter dots within the megaphone, represents the typical 'speech bubble', to add a friendly, social touch, while the deep red tones keep it grounded and professional. 
	Altogether, it captures both the creative and community-based side of the platform.
	
		
	</p>
	  
	<h3 class= "corporate-subtitle">Website design justification</h3>
	<p class= "corporate-bodytext" style="white-space: pre-line;"> The website is structured to be modern, clean, and engaging. It avoids clutter and focuses on showcasing user content, making navigation intuitive and visually satisfying for a creative audience.
		
	</p>
	  
	<h3 class= "corporate-undertext">Visual consistincy</h3>
	<p class= "corporate-bodytext" style="white-space: pre-line;"> The same fonts, colors, and graphic styles are used across all pages. This ensures the platform feels cohesive, trustworthy, and professionally designed, helping users associate a strong identity with the brand.
		
	</p>
	  
	<h3 class= "corporate-undertext">Navigation &amp; Layout</h3>
	<p class= "corporate-bodytext" style="white-space: pre-line;"> The horizontal scroll on the feed mimics social media platforms, fostering a familiar user experience. The use of structured menus and logical layouts ensures easy access to key areas like casting calls, profiles, and industry resources. This design keeps interactions fluid and intuitive, encouraging users to explore further without feeling lost in a sea of content.
		
	</p>
	  
	<h3 class= "corporate-undertext">Homepage</h3>

It highlights success stories to inspire newcomers while also providing clear navigation to create profiles and explore opportunities. By combining storytelling with usability, users are drawn in with both the emotional and practical appeal of the platform.
		
	</p>
	  
	<h3 class= "corporate-undertext">'The Limelight' page</h3>
	<p class= "corporate-bodytext" style="white-space: pre-line;"> The Limelight section serves as a curated space for actors to showcase updates, get noticed, and support each other’s growth. Users can find a variety of industry opportunities like accounts, open casting calls, workshops, and connections to theater clubs and theaters.

	</p>
