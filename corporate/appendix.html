    <h3 class= "corporate-subtitle">Testing protocol </h3>
	<p class= "corporate-bodytext" style="white-space: pre-line;"> To find out how easy and effective Rolecall is, we ran a series of user tests designed to mimic real-life situations. Some of the testers were online, some in person, so we could get a variety of feedback. We gave them tasks that were similar to what our users would actually do, like browsing casting calls, building a media portfolio, and writing to casting directors. We recorded their screens as they used the site and asked them to tell us what they thought about it. We then conducted short interviews to get a better idea of what worked, what didn’t, and where things got confusing. 

	The participants we tested are exactly the platform’s target audience—young, aspiring actors between the ages of 18 and 35, most of whom are early in their careers and don’t yet have an agent. They were looking for easier ways to find auditions, build their profile, and network with people in the industry. They were basically the ideal group to help us find out if Rolecall really delivers what it promises.

	<h3 class= "corporate-subtitle">Participants  </h3>
	<p class= "corporate-bodytext" style="white-space: pre-line;"> Adam (22), starting theater actor 
	Aneta (21), theater actress  
	Kelly (25), part-time actress 
	Tom (28), starting theater actor 
	Tariq (19), starting actor 
	Fabiana (54), marketing manager 
	Ema (19), creative business student 
	Yulia (19), university theater actress 
	Nout (22), theater actor and drama club member 
	Jeremy (24), aspiring musical actor
	Ahmet Baris (22), aspiring theater actor 
	Elpida (19), art school graduate, theater actress  
	  
	  </p>
	  
	<h3 class= "corporate-subtitle">Goals  </h3>
	<p class= "corporate-bodytext" style="white-space: pre-line;"> • Identify unseen friction points and confusing elements. 
	• Assess whether users can intuitively navigate the platform and successfully complete essential tasks. 
	• Evaluate whether the website’s design and content effectively communicate our brand identity and values. 
	  
	  </p>
	  
	<h3 class= "corporate-subtitle">Testing tasks   </h3>
	<p class= "corporate-bodytext" style="white-space: pre-line;"> • Upload actor's portfolio and contact an actor 
	• Find our social media pages and test their usability 
	• Filter actor's desired location in the Limelight section 
	  
	  </p>
	  
	<h3 class= "corporate-subtitle">Key findings  </h3>
	<p class= "corporate-bodytext" style="white-space: pre-line;"> • Lack of explanatory text for “Limelight” section, participants don't understand it unless we explain the purpose to them. 
	• Participants find “My account” very easy to navigate through, its function is useful. 
	• Users value clarity, simplicity, and customization in both design and functionality. 
	• The user found the concept of the platform very appealing, especially for actors without agents. 
	• They liked the idea of having auditions and networking in one place, reducing the need to juggle multiple websites and platforms. 
	• The idea of video resumes and portfolios stood out as especially useful — “like a highlight reel” for actors. 
	• The platform’s core ideas (centralized auditions, personalization, rich portfolios) strongly resonate with the target audience. 
	• There is a real emotional need to feel represented and supported — Role Call’s messaging and features are on the right track but need intuitive guidance during setup to fully deliver on that promise. 
	  
	  </p>
	  
	<h3 class= "corporate-subtitle">Positive feedback </h3>
	  <h4 class="corporate-undertext">First round of testing - Canva prototype </h4>
	<p class= "corporate-bodytext" style="white-space: pre-line;"> • The website catches attention immediately. 
	• “About us” section is clear and provides enough information about the brand. 
	• Participants would make use of this if it was an actual website.   </p>
	  
	  <h4 class="corporate-undertext">Second round of testing - website prototype  </h4>
	<p class= "corporate-bodytext" style="white-space: pre-line;"> • Participants liked the upload function of portfolio. 
	• The website is clear and works well. 
	• The website is very helpful, especially for people just getting started. 
	• This website would save a lot of time, participants wouldn't have to browse through different platforms. All they need is on one website – Rolecall. 
	• Media-rich profiles (including headshots, clips, and performances) were liked more than traditional resumes. 
	• The site feels more personal and targeted compared to sites like Backstage or StarNow. 
	• Participants like the Instagram/TikTok feature to find our social media. 
	• Participants showed an emotional reactions like curiosity, delight, and playfulness (e.g., commenting on Dutch text), indicating a strong user experience vibe, not just functionality. 
	  
	  </p>
	  
	<h3 class= "corporate-subtitle">Suggested improvements </h3>
	  <h4 class="corporate-undertext">After testing the Canva prototype  </h4>
	<p class= "corporate-bodytext" style="white-space: pre-line;"> • Needed feed section to upload own posts on my account. 
	• Make the portfolio upload in two versions, online and PDF file. 
	• Use more pictures in the home page, there is a lot of text. 
	• In my account, participants would like to see a profile with their picture, bio and general personal information. 
	• Change the name of the section “Limelight”, the purpose is unclear due to the name. 
	• First impression, unclear what the website is about. 
	• Link to both Instagram and personal websites, which could be added to account features.  </p>

	  <h4 class="corporate-undertext">After testing the website prototype  </h4>
	<p class= "corporate-bodytext" style="white-space: pre-line;"> • Change the name of the section “Limelight”, the purpose is unclear due to the name. 
	• In my account participants would like to see the option to sign up with Gmail, Facebook, Apple ID, etc. 
	• It was suggested to use more pictures and even videos. 
	• Suggestion to add a way to rate/review experiences from individual castings. 
	• To add an optional availability calendar. 
	• Add an optional template or structure for video portfolios to make the process less intimidating.  
	  
	  </p>
	  
	<h3 class= "corporate-subtitle">Conclusion   </h3>
	<p class= "corporate-bodytext" style="white-space: pre-line;"> Overall, the tests showed that Rolecall really resonated with the people it was designed for – young actors who are just starting out and looking for a better way to find auditions and showcase their work. People loved the idea of having everything in one place, especially the portfolio features with videos and photos, and the more personal feel of the platform compared to other platforms like Backstage. 

	At the same time, there were also some areas that caused confusion, such as: The Limelight section wasn’t entirely clear, and some areas where they felt the site could use more visual aids or instructions. Some users wished for easier sign-up options, an availability calendar, or templates that would help them create a profile without thinking about it. 

	Ultimately, Rolecall served its purpose very well, but there’s still room to make the experience smoother and more user-friendly. With a few changes based on this feedback, the website can be even more intuitive and friendly for actors who want to focus on their craft – and not deal with the technical side of things.  </p>
