	  	  <!-- social media choice -->
	<h3 class= "corporate-subtitle"> Social media choice</h3>
	<p class= "corporate-bodytext" style="white-space: pre-line;"> Our most important users are 18-30-year-old aspiring actors and theatre fans - a demographic that’s highly active on Instagram, with over 51% of Dutch Instagram users falling within the 18-34 age group (Statista, 2024). TikTok follows closely, with roughly half of our interviewees using it regularly. These platforms are where our audience already connects, gets inspired, and discovers new creative opportunities.

	As visually rich and performance-friendly platforms, Instagram and TikTok allow us to engage with our audience in an organic, entertaining, and authentic way. Whether it's audition tips, actor spotlights, portfolio reels, or backstage moments, our content strategy is designed to:
	• Build a community around shared passion and creativity
	• Drive engagement through trends, theatre-related challenges, and interactive content
	• Highlight users and open casting calls to boost visibility
	• Attract new talent organically through strong algorithmic reach

	By showing up where our audience already lives online, we make Rolecall part of their daily scroll - and their journey to the spotlight.

	  	 <!-- objectives -->
	<h3 class= "corporate-subtitle"> Objectives</h3>
	<h4 class= "corporate-detailtext">Reach (Communication + Measurable + Achievable)</h4>
	<p class= "corporate-bodytext" style="white-space: pre-line;"> By April 6th, 2025, reach 300 accounts. According to research, people create opinions about a brand based on its messaging, visibility, and consistency even before they interact with it directly (Edelman Trust Barometer, 2023). Reaching 300 people both on Instagram and TikTok is a good place to start when building credibility, particularly in the early stages of brand development. It enables us to establish a feeling of presence, test content strategies, and raise awareness. An active following of a few hundred people can create the groundwork for sustained growth and brand loyalty, according to Kevin Kelly's 1,000 True Fans concept.
	</p>
		
	<h4 class= "corporate-detailtext">Affect (Communication + Measurable)</h4>
	<p class= "corporate-bodytext" style="white-space: pre-line;"> We want to connect and inspire aspiring actors and creatives who are looking for community and guidance. Our goal is for our content to inspire people to consider and feel encouraged to pursue their creative endeavors. We want to promote deeper engagement through regular posting, value-driven content, and interactive Stories, whether it be through comments, shares, or platform participation. We think we can build a community by the campaign's conclusion that not only supports but also feels a strong emotional bond with our mission and brand.
	</p>
		
	<h4 class= "corporate-detailtext">Response (Communication + Measurable + Achievable)</h4>
	<p class= "corporate-bodytext" style="white-space: pre-line;"> An average of 300 views on Instagram Reels.
	• An average of 250 views on TikTok.
	• An average of 300 views on Instagram Feed.
	• An average of 10 likes on Instagram Reels and posts.
	• Over 300 accounts reached on Instagram.
	• An average of 1 comment on each post. According to Metricool (2025), there isn't an official limit to how many comments a brand can get, but spammy or excessive commenting activity can warrant temporary restrictions. It is preferable to focus on quality, authentic interactions rather than attempting to optimize for quantity.
		
	</p>
	  
	  	  <!-- campaign -->
	<h3 class= "corporate-subtitle">Campaign</h3>
	<p class= "corporate-bodytext" style="white-space: pre-line;"> We’re introducing Rolecall as a bold and inclusive creative hub for a new generation of theatre and acting talent. Through our first posts, we define who we are, what we stand for, and what sets us apart. By sharing our mission, vision, and team members, we build trust, rapport, and emotional investment with our audience. These posts humanize the brand and demonstrate that Rolecall is a space created by creatives for creatives.

	To help us reach our goal of 300 accounts by April 6th, we’re relying on highly visible formats like reels and TikToks. Our educational content, like audition tips and behind-the-scenes clips, offers value to emerging artists while increasing our discoverability. These pieces not only drive views, but also position Rolecall as a resourceful and accessible platform for creatives of all levels.

	Instagram Stories play a strategic role in driving engagement and community. Through interactive elements such as polls and Q&amp;A, we create a space for followers to share their desires and engage in meaningful dialogue. This helps turn passive viewers into active participants.

	As the campaign progresses, we introduce content related to the upcoming launch of our website and use teasers to build curiosity and anticipation. These updates reinforce the legitimacy of our platform and show that Rolecall is visionary and practical in what it offers.

	To maximize attention and deepen engagement, we write longer captions that include personal stories, insights or calls to action. We also use targeted hashtags in all posts and reels to increase visibility within the theatre and creative communities in the Netherlands.

	Overall, this campaign is not just about visibility – it is about building belonging. Rolecall aims to be more than just a platform. We are launching a movement that amplifies unheard voices, encourages bold creativity, and invites the next wave of theater artists to step into the spotlight.
		
	</p>
	
	  	 <!-- content calendar -->
	<h3 class= "corporate-subtitle">Content calendar</h3>
	<p class= "corporate-bodytext" style="white-space: pre-line;"> Initially, we focused on making a good first impression by posting several times in a short period of time. Between March 24 and 29, we posted three types of content on Instagram: a Feed, Stories, Reels, and TikTok. This gave us credibility and ensured that the page wasn't empty when new users discovered our page. Through a combination of posts - from brand and team introductions to audition tips - we tried to engage and bring the essence of our brand to life in a hurry.

	After the first wave, we switched to posting fairly evenly throughout the week starting in April. By making this adjustment, we've managed to retain existing followers while still attracting new ones. On April 9, we posted a behind-the-scenes video of the show at lunchtime and then developed a scheduling plan based on engagement patterns.
	On April 14, we also tested the timing of the posts - we moved the content drops in the later hours to the evening time between 6:00 and 7:00 pm. These later posts had significantly better reach and engagement, so we set this time as the time to post later content. In addition to reinforcing branding efforts, we also placed Reels and TikToks from different times in between to keep viewers as engaged as possible over time.
	We also posted teasers before the site launched to generate buzz. On 16 and 18 April, we used Instagram posts and stories to highlight key features and announce that the site was live. To ensure high engagement, on April 7 we added interactive tools such as Q&amp;A that were clearly visible within the post. These steps played a key role in keeping our audience engaged and invested in our progress.

	<p class= "corporate-bodytext" style="white-space: pre-line;"> We posted two Instagram Reels that fall within our content strategy and community building goals. The first reel is designed to help prospective Rolecall users by giving them a sense of the casting process. It features the trending audio “vibey birds of a feather” by jordangreenwald, which was selected for its easy discoverability and alignment with current engagement trends. The content is informative yet accessible, with the goal of making the casting process less overwhelming and more inviting for newcomers. The second reel is a stock footage clip from one of the theater training sessions. The video, set to the song “love letters” by Ophelia Wilde, depicts the emotional and personal growth that takes place in our training rooms. It serves to create a sense of kinship and aspiration – giving viewers a glimpse into a life-changing experience they could be part of. </p>

		<!-- Affect -->
	<h3 class= "corporate-subtitle">Affect</h3>
	<p class= "corporate-bodytext" style="white-space: pre-line;"> We successfully built initial momentum for Rolecall and surpassed key milestones. We surpassed our goal of 300 views on Instagram Reels with an average of 460 views, and our TikTok efforts reached 700 views despite a minimal number of posts. We also surpassed our goal of reaching 300 accounts and engaged over 980 accounts on Instagram. 
	Although interactions (likes and comments) were modest, the campaign showed meaningful engagement, especially with 6 responses to our Q&amp;A. These results confirm that Rolecall is not only gaining visibility, but is also generating real interest, creating a solid foundation for future growth and community building.
		
	</p>
	
		<!-- Response -->
	<h3 class= "corporate-subtitle">Response</h3>
	<p class= "corporate-bodytext" style="white-space: pre-line;"> • An average of 460 views on Instagram Reels. We surpassed our goal of 300 views successfully, which is very positive even though we didn’t post daily. This suggests that quality content and relevant audio can still perform well even with a lower posting frequency.
		
	• An average of 700 views on TikTok. This goal was surpassed quite surprisingly, since we weren’t very active there and only posted twice. Even though we could have had more interaction with the posts (likes and comments), it shows that the content still managed to reach beyond our expectations.
		
	• An average of 600 views on Instagram Feed. This is a solid result, indicating that our static posts still hold value and continue to engage our audience. It also confirms the importance of keeping a visual presence alongside Reels.
		
	• An average of 12 likes on Instagram Reels and posts. While this is a modest number, it shows consistent engagement. There’s definitely room for growth here, possibly through more call-to-action captions or interactive formats like carousels or polls.
		
	• Over 980 accounts reached on Instagram. Our original goal was to reach 300 accounts by April 6th, and we surpassed it by more than triple, reaching over 900 accounts. This is a major success and reflects the strength of our content and how well it resonated with our audience.
	
	• An average of 1 comment on each post. Even though this goal was easily achievable, we were disappointed that it wasn’t more. It seems like the audience isn’t very motivated to comment under posts. On the other hand, we did receive 6 responses on our Q&amp;A, which was encouraging and showed that there is interest in interactive formats.
	
	This campaign offered insightful information about audience engagement and content performance. In a number of areas, such as Instagram Reels, where we averaged 460 views, and TikTok, where we posted sparingly but received over 700 views, we were able to surpass our targets. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of relevant audio and high-quality content, even at lower posting frequencies. 
	With 600 views per post, our Instagram feed performed admirably, highlighting how crucial it is to keep up a visual presence in addition to Reels. Although there is potential for improvement in interactive formats like carousels and polls to promote greater user participation, likes (average of 12) demonstrated consistent engagement.

	Reaching over 980 Instagram accounts—more than tripling our initial target of 300 accounts—was a significant accomplishment. The six answers to the Q&amp;A demonstrated genuine interest in the interactive content, despite the fact that there were fewer comments than anticipated (an average of 1). We will concentrate on boosting engagement in the future by creating more tailored calls to action and looking into additional interactive possibilities to deepen our audience's emotional bond.
