	<h3 class= "corporate-subtitle"> Social media choice</h3>
	<p class= "corporate-bodytext" style="white-space: pre-line;"> Our most important users are 18-30-year-old aspiring actors and theatre fans - a demographic that’s highly active on Instagram, with over 51% of Dutch Instagram users falling within the 18-34 age group (Statista, 2024). TikTok follows closely, with roughly half of our interviewees using it regularly. These platforms are where our audience already connects, gets inspired, and discovers new creative opportunities.

	As visually rich and performance-friendly platforms, Instagram and TikTok allow us to engage with our audience in an organic, entertaining, and authentic way. Whether it's audition tips, actor spotlights, portfolio reels, or backstage moments, our content strategy is designed to:
	•    Build a community around shared passion and creativity
	•    Drive engagement through trends, theatre-related challenges, and interactive content
	•    Highlight users and open casting calls to boost visibility
	•    Attract new talent organically through strong algorithmic reach

	By showing up where our audience already lives online, we make Rolecall part of their daily scroll - and their journey to the spotlight.
		
	<h3 class= "corporate-subtitle"> Objectives</h3>
	<h4 class= "corporate-detailtext">Reach (Communication + Measurable + Achievable)</h4>
	<p class= "corporate-bodytext" style="white-space: pre-line;"> By April 6th, 2025, reach 300 accounts. According to research, people create opinions about a brand based on its messaging, visibility, and consistency even before they interact with it directly (Edelman Trust Barometer, 2023). Reaching 300 people both on Instagram and TikTok is a good place to start when building credibility, particularly in the early stages of brand development. It enables us to establish a feeling of presence, test content strategies, and raise awareness. An active following of a few hundred people can create the groundwork for sustained growth and brand loyalty, according to Kevin Kelly's 1,000 True Fans concept.
	
	<h4 class= "corporate-detailtext">Affect (Communication + Measurable)</h4>
	<p class= "corporate-bodytext" style="white-space: pre-line;"> We want to connect and inspire aspiring actors and creatives who are looking for community and guidance. Our goal is for our content to inspire people to consider and feel encouraged to pursue their creative endeavors. We want to promote deeper engagement through regular posting, value-driven content, and interactive Stories, whether it be through comments, shares, or platform participation. We think we can build a community by the campaign's conclusion that not only supports but also feels a strong emotional bond with our mission and brand.
		
	<h4 class= "corporate-detailtext">Response (Communication + Measurable + Achievable)</h4>
	<p class= "corporate-bodytext" style="white-space: pre-line;"> An average of 300 views on Instagram Reels.
	•   An average of 250 views on TikTok.
	•   An average of 300 views on Instagram Feed.
	•   An average of 10 likes on Instagram Reels and posts.
	•   Over 300 accounts reached on Instagram.
	•   An average of 1 comment on each post. According to Metricool (2025), there isn't an official limit to how many comments a brand can get, but spammy or excessive commenting activity can warrant temporary restrictions. It is preferable to focus on quality, authentic interactions rather than attempting to optimize for quantity.
